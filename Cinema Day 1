There is a practice of showing a cinema in the auditorium of a college on a cinema day. A cinema day is a day where the sum of Day(D), Month(M), Year(Y)should be divisible by product of 3 and 4. On that particular day the total number of students in the hostel should be greater than 50 but less than 100. Write a program to find whether the given day is cinema day or not.

    } else {
        printf("Not a Cinema Day\n");
